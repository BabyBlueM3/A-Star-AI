#### MatPlotLib
<li>To install MatPlotLib, you can type <b>pip install matplotlib</b> in the terminal</li> <br><br>

<li>To run:</li>
<li>Type py AStar.py in terminal</li>
<li>You will be given a list of grids to choose from. Select any number from 1-50.</li>
<li>You will see the first grid which will be the Repeated A* search with high g_score tie-breaking</li>
<li>When you close out of this matplotlib drawing, you will have another pop up, this will be Repeated A* search with low g_score tie-breaking</li>
<li>When you close out of this next drawing, you will have another which will be backwards Repeated A* search</li>
<li>When you close out of the backwards Repeated A* search, you will see the last which is Adaptive A* search</li>
<li>Lastly, when you close out of this window, the terminal will produce the path length results and the time it took to complete each search</li><br><br>

<li>The 50 grids will also be available to be seen in the same directory as the project itself</li>
